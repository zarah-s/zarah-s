#### Engineering with Rust & Solidity

As a seasoned full-stack web2 developer, I've spent years crafting web experiences and building scalable applications. Now, I'm embarking on an exciting new chapter — fully immersing myself in the dynamic realm of blockchain development.

Recently, I decided to transition fully into the blockchain ecosystem. Rust caught my attention due to its performance, safety, and versatility, making it an excellent choice for blockchain development. I am excited to leverage my web development skills in this new paradigm and contribute to the evolving world of decentralized applications.
